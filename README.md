# RESQ

Natural and man-made disasters often require the coordinated efforts of multiple rescue agencies to provide timely and effective relief. To address this need, we propose the development of an application that centralizes information about registered rescue agencies and displays their locations on a map. This application will also facilitate communication and collaboration among agencies, enhancing their ability to respond to emergencies efficiently. By harnessing technology to improve coordination, the Rescue Agency Coordination Application aims to save lives and reduce the impact of disasters.


## PROBLEM STATEMENT
During natural or man-made calamities, the lack of a centralized platform for rescue agency coordination can result in inefficiencies, delayed response times, and missed opportunities for collaboration. Agencies often struggle to locate and communicate with each other, hindering their ability to provide aid effectively.
